          <h3>Final Look</h3>
          <p class="news">
            i think this is the final design that im going to use. it looks nice, it's crisp, it's professional...i like it!
          </p>
          <h3>First NetNavi?</h3>
          <p class="news">
            well, this will be a huge and ambitious undertaking, but i don't think it's impossible...after all, how hard could it be to make an emotion simulation program, right?
            <img src="http://pw-software.5u.com/netnavi project/G_Mind-head.jpg">
            this is a mugshot of my fan NetNavi, Guincool Mind.EXE, and his logo. right now i am trying to figure out the rest of the body...
          </p>
          <h3>PET OS</h3>
          <p class="news">
            this will most likely be <b>much</b> easier to program than a NetNavi...i'll put up screens when i can and i want your input people!

          <p>
            when i first played MMBN, i thought how cool it would be if all the technological advances in that game would be if we were using it. this was around the time when the first game came out...of course, my younger self thought it would be as easy as tying my shoe (okay, so not <b>that</b> easy). anyways, i had a concept for my own NetNavi, which i named Guincool MindEXE ("guin" as in "penguin"). right now, i am making various sketches and i will soon begin the 3D modelling and when that is to my specifications, i will make a rather crude a.i. and emotion simulation program...which will get polished afterwards. i just want to make a prototype and then show MMBN fans that having a NetNavi could very well be possible...stay tuned!
            here are some of my notes...</p>

            <b>.:basic concept of NetNavis:.</b>
            <li>NetNavis are computerized humanoid combat data and can talk to their operators and express emotion. they can be fully customizable, ranging frm their appearance, to their personality, to their weaponry. each NetNavi has a standard weapon, a weapon they can call up on their own and use at anytime BUT to use other attacks (BattleChips), they need the help of their operator. NetNavis are generally used to delete viruses, but can be used to help with the operator's occupation.

                                  <b>.:neural networks:.</b>
                                  <li>neural networks are networks of processors set up to interact with one another. they are computational paradigms that implement a simplified model of the biological brain. the biological brain consists of local neuron assemblages and dendrte connections. neural networks use highly distributed representations and transformations. the use of neural networks allow AI machines to process info in parallel like the brain and perform calculations much faster.
                                    the perception is a classification of feedfoward neural networks, the nodes, or artificial neurons, in a layer sum their inputs, which may be weighted, and provide a response (output) if a threshold value is reached. there may be a single layer or more of nodes which direct their output to the next layer.<br>
                                  <li>a node in neural networks is similar to the neuron of the biological system. it receives input from connections and produces output, which depends on the input. a group of these nodes and their connections for other nodes in the subsequent layer. the group of nodes that are at the same hierachical level form a layer. note that info only proceeds forward, and there are generally no loops in the network. groups of nodes are usually divided into three layers in feedforward neural networks: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. the input layer is analgous to sensory neurons in that it simply gathers data. the hidden layer is similar to interneurons and is responsible for processing the info along with the output layer, which could be compared to motor
                                    neurons.
                                  <li>multi-layer neural networks are usually feed-forward. each node of the preceding layer has a connection with one or more nodes in the subsequent layer. learning techniques, such as back-propagation which requires a loop in the network, are often utilized in multi-layer networks. they work by bringing the network  into a steady state when a certain input is present.
                                  <li>recurrent neural networks differ from feed-forward networks in that data may flow backwards and forwards. subsequent layers may provide output to preceding layers. nodes may even supply input to themselves.
                                  <li>a neural network learns by training itself on sample patterns and attempts to locate the error between predictions and actual targets. there are algorithms in use for adjusting synaptic weights.
                                  <li>neural networks provide solutions to very complex and difficult problems. non-linear problems that cannot be solved with standard algorithms may be solved with a neural network.
                                  <li>training takes just a fraction of the CPU time that error methods take.
                                  <li>an artificial neural network is a somewhat simplfied model of the biological neuron, which is a brain cell that is assembled together with weighted connections called synapses.
                                  <li>neural networks can approximate almost any finite dimensional vector function on a set.
                                  <li>neural networks can extract very complex mathematical functions.
                                  <li>neural networks can do everything a digital computer can do and more.
                                  <li>neural networks have the excellent ability to derive meaning from non-linear or imprecise data.
