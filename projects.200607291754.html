          <p>
            when i first played MMBN, i thought how cool it would be if all the technological advances in that game would be if we were using it. this was around the time when the first game came out...of course, my younger self thought it would be as easy as tying my shoe (okay, so not <b>that</b> easy). anyways, i had a concept for my own NetNavi, which i named Guincool MindEXE ("guin" as in "penguin"). right now, i am making various sketches and i will soon begin the 3d modelling and when that is to my specifications, i will make a rather crude a.i. and emotion simulation program...which will get polished afterwards. i just want to make a prototype and then show MMBN fans that having a NetNavi could very well be possible...stay tuned!
            here are some of my notes...</p>
          <p>
            .:Basic Concept of NetNavis:.<br>
            +NetNavis are computerized humanoid combat data and can talk to their operators and express emotion. they can be fully customizable, ranging frm their appearance, to their personality, to their weaponry. each NetNavi has a standard weapon, a weapon they can call up on their own and use at anytime BUT to use other attacks (BattleChips), they need the help of their operator. NetNavis are generally used to delete viruses, but can be used to help with the operator's occupation.<br>
          <p>
            .:default stats:.<br>
            +100 HP<br>
            +signature weapon attack is 1<br>
            +signature weapon speed is 1<br>
            +signature weapon charge is 1<br>
            +normal style/ form<br>
          <p>
            .:files that make up NetNavis:.<br>
            +Net_Navi. EXE (actual Navi progam)<br>
            +Net_Navi1. PNG (Navi frame and blueprint)<br>
            +Net_Navi2. PNG (clothing, face, gloves, boots, etc.)<br>
            +Net_Navi3. PNG (insignia/ symbol)<br>
            +Net_Navi. DLL (tells what vvoice sounds like, what his/ her weapons are, how to execute battlechip info, etc.)<br>
            +Weapons. EXE (allows NetNavi to boot this program into .DLL fle to be used by him/ her. this is automatically done for battlechips)<br>
            +Stream. DAT (reduces NetNavi to a blue stream of light [color could be customized] and compresses him/ her for faster transmission to areas)<br>
            +Net_Navi. LOG (NetNavi's "memory" and it stores info...like your appointments and such)<br>
            +Emotion Simulation Program ("defining condition of humanity?"...allows users to interact more with their Navis)<br>
          <ul>
            +expectation <-> actuality<br>
            +rage <-> fear<br>
            +fight <-> flight<br>
            +pain <-> pleasure<br>
            +self-asserting <-> self-transcending<br>
            +instability <-> stability<br>
            +participating <-> warding-off<br>
            +relaxation <-> tension<br>
            </ul>
            +layers of protection programs...like layers of skin!<br>
            <p>
              .:Chng. BAT:.<br>
              +this is a program that acts like a seed to stengthen your Navi. that's why you won't see anything significant when this is first installed. after a certain amount of battles, your Navi will go through a "Style Change" and gain a new elemental attribute as well as other powers.<br>
            <p>
              .:note#1:.<br>
              +a Navi needs its personality, physical attributes, mental capabilities, and stength directly linking to its .EXE program.<br>
            <p>
              .:definition#1:.<br>
              +personality is the totality of distinctive traits of a specific being and an individually unique, consistent pattern of behaivor and psychological attributes that endure over time and across situations.<br>
            <p>
              .:Mr. Prog:.<br>
              +this little green helper programs aren't Navis, but they are close to being them. they can handle simple and complex tasks. i should use a lot of these to help with the projects. another note...Mr. Progs hate uncertainty and so they see the world in terms of zeroes and ones...also, they have a tendency to yell when they speak.<br>
            <p>
              .:definition#2:.<br>
              +a.i. is a type of computer system or program that learns, gathers info, and solves problems by creatively thinking for itself.<br>
            <p>
              .:note#2:.<br>
              +attack power doubles in CrossFusion...R Guincool Mind...Rush Synchro Chip enhances the user's synchronization level...brainwaves fuse together.<br>
            <p>
              .:mental capabilities:.<br>
              +extensive range of vocabulary (like a dictionary)<br>
              +calculates in an instant<br>
              +remembers/ calls forth previous knowledge<br>
              +can remember names and faces<br>

              +language<br>
              +speech<br>
              +writing<br>
              +calculation<br>
              +time sense<br>
              +rhythm<br>
              +ordering of complex movements<br>
            <p>
              .:right brain:.<br>
              +non-verbal<br>
              +perceptual skills<br>
              +visualization<br>

              +expression of emotion<br>
              +simple language comprehension<br>
            <p>
              .:etc:.<br>
              +Latent Learning -> kinda like remembering...attention system with the capability to shift backwards in time to reinforce older information.<br>
              +NetNavis can remotely access everything on your PC or PET.<br>
              +being that the PET is voice-activated, your NetNavi can type what you dictate for hands-free messaging!<br>
            <p>
              .:Neural Networks:.<br>
              +neural networks are networks of processors set up to interact with one another. they are computational paradigms that implement a simplified model of the biological brain. the biological brain consists of local neuron assemblages and dendrte connections. neural networks use highly distributed representations and transformations. the use of neural networks allow AI machines to process info in parallel like the brain and perform calculations much faster.<br>
              +the perception is a classification of feedfoward neural networks, the nodes, or artificial neurons, in a layer sum their inputs, which may be weighted, and provide a response (output) if a threshold value is reached. there may be a single layer or more of nodes which direct their output to the next layer.<br>
              +a node in neural networks is similar to the neuron of the biological system. it receives input from connections and produces output, which depends on the input. a group of these nodes and their connections for other nodes in the subsequent layer. the group of nodes that are at the same hierachical level form a layer. note that info only proceeds forward, and there are generally no loops in the network. groups of nodes are usually divided into three layers in feedforward neural networks: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. the input layer is analgous to sensory neurons in that it simply gathers data. the hidden layer is similar to interneurons and is responsible for processing the info along with the output layer, which could be compared to motor
              neurons.<br>
              +multi-layer neural networks are usually feed-forward. each node of the preceding layer has a connection with one or more nodes in the subsequent layer. learning techniques, such as back-propagation which requires a loop in the network, are often utilized in multi-layer networks. they work by bringing the network  into a steady state when a certain input is present.<br>
              +recurrent neural networks differ from feed-forward networks in that data may flow backwards and forwards. subsequent layers may provide output to preceding layers. nodes may even supply input to themselves.<br>
              +a neural network learns by training itself on sample patterns and attempts to locate the error between predictions and actual targets. there are algorithms in use for adjusting synaptic weights.<br>
              +neural networks provide solutions to very complex and difficult problems. non-linear problems that cannot be solved with standard algorithms may be solved with a neural network.<br>
              +training takes just a fraction of the CPU time that error methods take.<br>
              +an artificial neural network is a somewhat simplfied model of the biological neuron, which is a brain cell that is assembled together with weighted connections called synapses.<br>
              +neural networks can approximate almost any finite dimensional vector function on a set.<br>
              +neural networks can extract very complex mathematical functions.<br>
              +neural networks can do everything a digital computer can do and more.<br>
              +neural networks have the excellent ability to derive meaning from non-linear or imprecise data.<br>

              i actually got this idea from a fanfic i was reading a while ago. however, i have absolutely <b>no</b> idea which one it was...i do know that it was on fanfiction.net (megaman obviously). anyways, the concept of Gingnet is this: basically, it is a huge cyber library that has lots of dictionary terms for things in the MMBN universe...like YumCode and BattleChip for example. my version however, will have various computer-related terms in addition to those related to MMBN. this section will one that will <b>always</b> be updated.

              <li>.:B:.</li><br>
              BattleChip: a special form of diskette that contains combat data for NetNavis. when loaded into the PET's slot-in drive, the data will be transmitted to the Navi. BattleChips come in a wide variety and are often purchased like trading cards. furthermore, some BattleChips are collected for their rarity.<br><br>
              Bug: an error in programming that may cause potentially dangerous malfunctions.<br><br>
              <li>.:C:.</li><br>
              <li>.:D:.</li><br>
              Delete: the complete erasing of data. when virii or Navis are damamged enough, their data will be deleted and lost. though Navis can be reprogrammed, their memory data is often lost. the concept of a virus or Navi being deleted is equivalent to the concept of a human being killed.<br><br>
              <li>.:E:.</li><br>
              Elec: an elemental attribute of certain virii and Navis. elec represents electric types. the elec element is weak to the wood element and is powerful against the aqua element.<br><br>

              <li>.:I:.</li><br>
              Independent NetNavi: a Navi without a NetOp. independent NetNavis have superior programming and are able to use a variety of powerful attacks without the aid of BattleChips.<br><br>

              Jack-In: the process of using the PET's wireless transmitter to connect to a device via it's wireless transmitter. when NetOps jack-in and transmit their NetNavi, they often shout this term aloud. moreso, the concept cancelling the wireless connection is referred to as "jack-out".<br><br>
              <li>.:K:.</li><br>
              <li>.:L:.</li><br>
              Log-Out: when a Navi is outside of the PET and is transmitted back to the PET, it logs out of the network. sometimes, when Navis are damaged in certain ways during combat, they are automatically logged out as a sort of "deletion airbag".<br><br>
              <li>.:M:.</li><br>
              <li>.:N:.</li><br>

              Net Agents: a secret organization of agents that set out to stop NetCrime syndicates. net agents keep their identities a secret, often going out on duty in superhero-like costumes.<br><br>
              NetBattle: the process of competing in battle against viruses or Navis. NetBattles are usually done for sport, but they are also a neccessity in battling NetCrimes.<br><br>
              NetBattler: a term referring to someone who NetBattles. almost all NetOps are NetBattlers, so the terms are often interchangable.<br><br>
              NetCrime: a form of criminal activity performed via the internet using NetNavis and virii.<br><br>
              NetNavi: short for NetNavigator, NetNavis are a special form of artificial intelligent programming loaded in PETs. Navis are given a unique personality that often reflects upon the NetOperator's personality. Navis perform various tasks on the PET for the NetOperator and can be sent into devices (using the process of jacking-in) to battle computer virii. Navis usually develop a strong friendship with their NetOperators.<br><br>
              NetOp: short for NetOperator, he/she is the owner and operator of a PET and his/her Navi.<br><br>

              PET: short for either PErsonal Terminal or Personal Exploration Terminal, this handheld device has countless features, ranging from a cell phone to wireless e-mail to even television! PETs are used for personal convenience as well as machinery with the use of jacking-in.<br><br>
              P.A.: short for Program Advance, this is achieved when three or more BattleChips are loaded into the PET in a certain order. the BattleChips' data combines to form one super-attack. P.A.s are very hard to pull off, for they require that the NetOp and the NetNavi synchronize their breathing.<br><br>
              <li>.:Q:.</li><br>
              <li>.:R:.</li><br>
              <li>.:S:.</li><br>
              Slot-In: the process of inserting a BattleChip into the PET's slot-in drive. NetOperators often shout this term (along with the BattleChip's name) when inserting BattleChips.<br><br>
              Standard Attack: an attack in a Navi's programming that can be performed without the aid of BattleChips.<br><br>
              StyleChange: a technique only available to those NetNavis that have Chng.BAT installed, StyleChanges allow them to temporarily change their element and weaponry. there are a wide variety of styles.<br><br>
              <li>.:T:.</li><br>
              Transmission: the sending of a signal, picture, or other info from a transmitter. the act of transmission is used when Navis are sent into devices via jacking-in. the term "transmission" is often shouted aloud by the NetOperator in the process of jacking-in.<br><br>
              <li>.:U:.</li><br>
              <li>.:V:.</li><br>
