          <h3>Final Look</h3>
          <p class="news">

          <h3>First NetNavi?</h3>
          <p class="news">
            well, this will be a huge and ambitious undertaking, but i don't think it's impossible...after all, how hard could it be to make an emotion simulation program, right?
            <img src="http://pw-software.5u.com/netnavi project/G_Mind-head.jpg">
            this is a mugshot of my fan NetNavi, Guincool Mind.EXE, and his logo. right now i am trying to figure out the rest of the body...
          </p>
          <h3>PET OS</h3>
          <p class="news">
            this will most likely be <b>much</b> easier to program than a NetNavi...i'll put up screens when i can and i want your input people!

          <h2>Nintendo DS Browser</h2>
          <p>
            now that the Nintendo DS can go online, there's no telling what possibilites for expansion of the NDS universe will be uncovered! PW Software recognizes this, and we will definitely be looking into new applications...in fact, we're doing it now!
          </p>
          <p>
            hey! you can order the new browser at Play-Asia (the link is on the left sidebar) as well as other cool imports. check it out!

          <p>
            i think that i'll work on this after im about 80% done with my own NetNavi. at that time, i'll make a type of customization engine. maybe doing the generic NetNavis would be easier...anyhoo, my idea right now is this: people can create their NetNavi online and then download the PET OS onto their PC (i'll work on one for Mac too) and there you have it! of course, it would be better if there were actual PETs out there. it does seem like the NDS is becoming the new PET though...HEY! there <b>are</b> GBA flash carts out there, annnnnd the NDS has a beautiful battery life on standby. ok! i will look more into this at a later date.
          </p>
          <h2 id="petos"><a href="#">PET OS</a></h2>
          <p>
            there will be screens for this! i cannot stress this enough! im so excited for it myself and i didn't even start programming yet (well, at the time of this writing). i should start looking at hirng people.

          <h2 id="netsite_m"><a href="#">NetSite Maker</a></h2>
          <p>
            yeah yeah, i know that "net" and "site" mean the same thing but it sounds cool (to me, and that's <b>all</b> that matters, lol). if you've played at least 2 MMBN games, you know that everyone in the game has their own personal space in the 'Net...like a webpage, but it's in 3D. if i get enough of these made, then they could all connect to a central area...like NetCity! hmm...it would be nice if <b>every</b> single 'Net area in MMBN was made. oh yeah! if you want to turn off your computer or whatever the case may be, you can let your NetNavi stay online in your NetSite!
